                        This is a very simple plugin with just one feature. It gets the email ids of all the people who have commented 
                        on your website(any page).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>How this works ?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        WordPress maintains a database table which contains all the comments and and their details
                        (eg user name, email id etc). What this plugin does is it extracts all those email ids
                        from the table and displays it on the screen.
                    </p>
                    <p>Please note that it can extract  the email ids of only comments which are there in your
                    WebPage, for example if you deleted a comment manually it cannot get that email id.</p>
                    <p>

          div
            p
              | This is a very simple plugin with just one feature. It gets the email ids of all the people who have commented
              | on your website(any page).
            p
              b How this works ?
            p
              | WordPress maintains a database table which contains all the comments and and their details
              | (eg user name, email id etc). What this plugin does is it extracts all those email ids
              | from the table and displays it on the screen.
            p
              | Please note that it can extract  the email ids of only comments which are there in your
              | WebPage, for example if you deleted a comment manually it cannot get that email id.
            p
              b The author of the plugin is not responsible for any damage done by the plugin.
              |  This plugin
              |                                       has been tested both in localhost(home server example xampp/lamp) and in production server(actual
              |                                       web server). It works great in both the above places and no problems has been caused by this plugin.
